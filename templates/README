Build/Schedule templates
=========================

For each notification method, the set-template.txt file lists the build and
schedule templates to use.

The default behavior is to use the template specified by the "buildTemplate"
and "scheduleTemplate" properties (in set-template.txt).

The optional behavior is to set templates for specific schedules by setting a property named
"<project>_<schedule>_buildTemplate" (or "_scheduleTemplate").  Where "<project>" is the name of the project
and "<schedule>" is the name of the schedule (spaces should be replaced with "_").
