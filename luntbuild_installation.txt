Introduction

  Installation using Luntbuild installer is the easiest way to install Luntbuild.
  We recommend to use the installer for all Luntbuild standard installations including
  upgrades. See section A and D for details.

  In case you need to modify for some reason Luntbuild configuration files (web.xml etc.)
  with attributes/values beyond the attributes/values modified by Luntbuild installer,
  you might choose installation using Luntbuild distribution zip file. See section B for details.

  In case you need to modify and/or extend the source code implementation of Luntbuild,
  you might to choose to build Luntbuild distribution from the source code. See section C
  for details.

  Supported application servers/servlet containers (Servlet 2.3 and JSP 1.2 support
   are required)
  ---------------------------------------------------
 * Tomcat 4.x
 * Tomcat 5.5
 * Jetty 4.2.23
 * Jetty 5.1.12
 * Resin 3.0.12
 * JBoss 4.0.1RC2
 * JBoss 3.2.7
 * JOnAS 4.3.3
 * SunOne 6.1
 * Orion 2.x

 Luntbuild may work with other application servers/servlet containers but
 it is not tested with them.

A. Installation using Luntbuild installer (with GUI)
----------------------------------------------------

  It you are upgrading from previous version of Luntbuild, before you install new version
  perform the following tasks:
  
  * Export your Luntbuild data for current version of Luntbuild (Administration tab)
  * Backup your DB (if you use external database) and your current Luntbuild installation
  * Shutdown the servlet container that is used to run Luntbuild (if any)
  * Delete luntbuild schema from DB (if you use external database)
  
  NOTE: For upgrades from version 1.1.1, please refer to section D of this file.

  1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which
     contains the java and jar executable into your system path(IMPORTANT!)
     Go to "http://java.sun.com/" for JDK download, if you didn't install it yet.

  2) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application
     server installed, and make sure it has
     been stopped.

  3) Download Luntbuild installer from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/"
     or from Javaforge: http://www.javaforge.com/proj/doc.do?doc_id=1205
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar", where xxx denotes
      current version.

  4) Run command "java -jar luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar". A GUI will display to
      guide you through the installation, and Luntbuild will install into the selected
      directory, let's say "/opt/luntbuild".

  5) Deploy luntbuild.war (located in "/opt/luntbuild" directory) into your servlet
     container or application server. Note, that if you selected the deployment
     directory of your servlet container or application server during installation,
     the installer will deploy luntbuild.war for you.

  6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your
     Luntbuild adventure, :D

B. Installation using zip distribution (without GUI)
----------------------------------------------------

  It you are upgrading from previous version of Luntbuild, before you install new version,
  perform the following tasks:
  
  * Export your Luntbuild data for current version of Luntbuild (Administration tab)
  * Backup your DB (if you use external database) and your current Luntbuild installation
  * Shutdown the servlet container that is used to run Luntbuild (if any)
  * Delete luntbuild schema from DB (if you use external database)
  
  NOTE: For upgrades from version 1.1.1, please refer to section D of this file.

  1) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application
     server installed, and make sure it has been stopped.

  3) Download the Luntbuild zip distribution from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/"
     or from Javaforge: http://www.javaforge.com/proj/doc.do?doc_id=1205.
     This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx.zip", where xxx denotes current version.

  4) Extract the zip file into the directory where you want to install Luntbuild, say
     "/opt/luntbuild". And edit the following files with your text editor:
     * Edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/web.xml":
       Replace "$INSTALL_PATH" with your Luntbuild installation path (/opt/luntbuild here).
     * Optionally edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/users.properties":
	   Replace "luntbuild=luntbuild" with your desired site administrator password
	   in the format "luntbuild=youradminpassword". NOTE, that admin user HAS to be "luntbuild".

  5) If you use LDAP, edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/ldap.properties" and
     follow Luntbuild documentation to configure LDAP.
     
  5) Copy all the contents under "/opt/luntbuild/web" directory, and deploy it as a web application to
      your application server, or servlet container. For example, if you are using
      Tomcat servlet container:

        - Make Tomcat sure has been stopped
        - Change to Tomcat install dir:
             > cd <tomcat install dir>/webapps
        - Make luntbuild directory:
             > mkdir luntbuild
        - Copy luntbuild/web to webapps:
             > cp -r /opt/luntbuild/web/* <tomcat install dir>/webapps/luntbuild
        - Start Tomcat

        Note. Do NOT create luntbuild.war file, just copy the contents under "/opt/luntbuild/web" directory
        to the luntbuild directory in the appropriate web application directory of your
        application server, or servlet container.

  6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your
     Luntbuild adventure, :D

C. Building Luntbuild from source distribution
----------------------------------------------

  1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which
     contains the java and jar executable into your system path.
     Go to "http://java.sun.com/" for JDK download, if you didn't install it yet.

  2) Make sure you have Apache ant 1.6.1 (or higher) installed.
     Goto "http://ant.apache.org" for Ant download.

  3) Check out the source distribution from SVN repository at:
     "http://www.javaforge.com/proj/summary.do?proj_id=70".

  4) Extract the source distribution into a directory, let's say
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src". Change to directory
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src/build", and run command "ant clean installer"
     or "ant clean zip".
     Then Luntbuild installer or zip distribution will both be generated into directory
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src/distribute".

  5) Follow the installation procedures in sections A, B, or D to install Luntbuild.

D. Upgrading Luntbuild (with special notes for upgrading Luntbuild 1.x)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) Assuming you've installed Luntbuild under "/opt/luntbuild". Backup
     the directory "/opt/luntbuild/db" which contains your db files to another location.
     Backup all important build artifacts.

  2) If your previously installed version is 1.1.1, upgrade 1.1.1 web application
     with war file from:
     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113344&package_id=122604&release_id=319662

     NOTE: This only upgrades web application, and should not change anything
     under "/opt/luntbuild".

  3) Access Luntbuild web application again, Select "Administration" tab, and export
     data into your specified file, let's say "/yourhome/luntbuild-data.xml". This file
     will be stored on the machine that runs your servlet container or application server
     hosting your Luntbuild application.

  4) Follow the instructions of section A of this file to install new release of Luntbuild
     into your previous Luntbuild installation directory, that is "/opt/luntbuild"
     in this case.

  5) Access the Luntbuild web application, click on "Administration" tab, and
     import from previously exported data file "/yourhome/luntbuild-data.xml".
     That will migrate data of previous Luntbuild installation to latest version.
     However, if your previous version is 1.1.1, some settings needs to be re-configured:

     * The property "environment file" has been removed in 1.2. If you are using
       this property in 1.1.1, you need to extract contents of the environment
       file, and enter them as "Environment variables" property.

     * All build success condition has been reset for 1.2 format and above.

     * All build necessary condition has been reset for 1.2 format and above.

     * Format of property "Next build version" has been changed in 1.2, please verify
       your version string.

     * Build properties passed to Ant build script has been changed in 1.2, thus your
       Ant build script need to be changed to use new build properties.

     * Ant builder command has been reset to default value. You may need to change
       it based on your Ant installation directory.
