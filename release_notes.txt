UI/Help/Documentation
- Added chapter to documentation on notification templates and their use.
- Updated the link to the cron trigger help on schedule edit page.
- Added ability for interface tabs to hide themselves.

Build System
- Expanded JavaDoc to include all classes.
- Added links to external JavaDocs.
- Added separate API JavaDocs.
- Added descriptions to all targets.
- Separated API documentation generation from API compiling.

General
- Fix for system properties not immediately updating when importing a new config.  The webapp was not updating its copy of the properties.

- Added ability to configure templates for specific schedules (this could be better done though).
- Added new notification strategy "Notify if failed or status changed".
- Fixed error messages in TemplatedNotifier.

Contribution from Dominique Leducq. Thanks Dominique!

- Added variables support for a schedule. Variables can be used in the similar fashion as project variables in OGNL expressions.

luntbuild 1.3.6 Release Notes
==============================================

Bugs fixed:

Fixed current build update in web app introduced in 1.3.5
MKS integration improvements:
   1. When an objects gets removed form the MKS repository, checking for revisions used to fail (with MKS API error) and failed the build. Now error gets reported into revision log and build proceeds.
   2. Logic was enhanced to detect changes in the MKS modules. Adding/changing the version/checkpoint label or development path to existing MKS module no longer fails the build. Once a change is detected sandbox is dropped and recreated with changed parameters.
StarTeam patch which adds the ability to check out by promotional state to Luntbuild

7. Installing Luntbuild

  Installation using Luntbuild installer is the easiest way to install Luntbuild.
  We recommend to use the installer for all Luntbuild standard installations including
  upgrades. See section A and D for details.

  In case you need to modify for some reason Luntbuild configuration files (web.xml,
  applicationContext.xml) with attributes/values beyond the attributes/values modified
  by Luntbuild installer, you might choose installation using Luntbuild distribution
  zip file. See section B for details.

  In case you need to modify and/or extend the source code implementation of Luntbuild,
  you might to choose to build Luntbuild distribution from the source code. See section C
  for details.

  If you are upgrading from previous releases,  please refer to section D.


A. Installation using Luntbuild installer (with GUI)
----------------------------------------------------

  NOTE: This is clean installation of Luntbuild. For upgrades from version 1.1.1,
  please refer to section D of this file.

  1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which
     contains the java and jar executable into your system path(IMPORTANT!)
     Go to "http://java.sun.com/" for JDK download, if you didn't install it yet.

  2) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application
     server installed, and make sure it has
     been stopped.

  3) Download Luntbuild installer from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/".
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar", where xxx denotes
      current version.

  4) Run command "java -jar luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar". A GUI will display to
      guide you through the installation, and Luntbuild will install into the selected
      directory, let's say "/opt/luntbuild".

  5) Deploy luntbuild.war (located in "/opt/luntbuild" directory) into your servlet
     container or application server. Note, that if you selected the deployment
     directory of your servlet container or application server during installation,
     the installer will deploy luntbuild.war for you.

  6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your
     Luntbuild adventure, :D

B. Installation using zip distribution (without GUI)
----------------------------------------------------

  NOTE: This is clean installation of Luntbuild. For upgrades from version 1.1.1,
  please refer to section D of this file.

  1) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application
     server installed, and make sure it has been stopped.

  3) Download the Luntbuild zip distribution from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/".
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx.zip", where xxx denotes current version.

  4) Extract the zip file into the directory where you want to install Luntbuild, say
     "/opt/luntbuild". And edit the following files with your text editor:
     * Edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/web.xml":
       Replace "$INSTALL_PATH" with your Luntbuild installation path (/opt/luntbuild here).
       Replace "${sessionTimeout}" with your desired session timeout value (normally 30).
     * Edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml":
	   Replace "${luntbuildPassword}" with your desired site administrator password.

  5) Copy all the contents under "/opt/luntbuild/web" directory, and deploy it as a web application to
      your application server, or servlet container. For example, if you are using
      Tomcat servlet container:

        - Make Tomcat sure has been stopped
        - Change to Tomcat install dir:
             > cd <tomcat install dir>/webapps
        - Make luntbuild directory:
             > mkdir luntbuild
        - Copy luntbuild/web to webapps:
             > cp -r /opt/luntbuild/web/* <tomcat install dir>/webapps/luntbuild
        - Start Tomcat

        Note. Do NOT create luntbuild.war file, just copy the contents under "/opt/luntbuild/web" directory
        to the luntbuild directory in the appropriate web application directory of your
        application server, or servlet container.

  6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your
     Luntbuild adventure, :D

C. Building Luntbuild from source distribution
----------------------------------------------

  1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which
     contains the java and jar executable into your system path.
     Go to "http://java.sun.com/" for JDK download, if you didn't install it yet.

  2) Make sure you have Apache ant 1.6.1 (or higher) installed.
     Goto "http://ant.apache.org" for Ant download.

  3) Download the source distribution from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/".
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx-src.zip", where xxx denotes
      current version.

  4) Extract the source distribution into a directory, let's say
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src". Change to directory
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src/build", and run command "ant clean installer zip".
     Then Luntbuild installer and zip distribution will both be generated into directory
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src/distribute".

  5) Follow the installation procedures in sections A, B, or D to install Luntbuild.

D. Upgrading from 1.1.1, 1.2 beta1, 1.2 beta2, 1.2, 1.2.1, 1.2.2
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) Assuming you've installed Luntbuild under "/opt/luntbuild". Backup
     the directory "/opt/luntbuild/db" which contains your db files to another location.
     Backup all important build artifacts.

  2) If your previously installed version is 1.1.1, upgrade 1.1.1 web application
     with war file from:
     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113344&package_id=122604&release_id=319662

     NOTE: This only upgrades web application, and should not change anything
     under "/opt/luntbuild".

  3) Access Luntbuild web application again, Select "Administration" tab, and export
     data into your specified file, let's say "/yourhome/luntbuild-data.xml". This file
     will be stored on the machine that runs your servlet container or application server
     hosting your Luntbuild application.

  4) Follow the instructions of section A of this file to install new release of Luntbuild
     into your previous Luntbuild installation directory, that is "/opt/luntbuild"
     in this case.

  5) Access the Luntbuild web application, click on "Administration" tab, and
     import from previously exported data file "/yourhome/luntbuild-data.xml".
     That will migrate data of previous Luntbuild installation to latest version.
     However, if your previous version is 1.1.1, some settings needs to be re-configured:

     * The property "environment file" has been removed in 1.2. If you are using
       this property in 1.1.1, you need to extract contents of the environment
       file, and enter them as "Environment variables" property.

     * All build success condition has been reset for 1.2 format and above.

     * All build necessary condition has been reset for 1.2 format and above.

     * Format of property "Next build version" has been changed in 1.2, please verify
