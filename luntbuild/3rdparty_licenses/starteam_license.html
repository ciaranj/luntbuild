<p>Borland is only willing to grant you this License if you obtained the Product from Borland or a Borland authorized reseller. If you obtained the Product from any other source you may not install or use the Product.</p>

<p>1.	OWNERSHIP.  The Product is proprietary to Borland.  The Product is licensed, not sold, to you notwithstanding any reference herein to &quot;purchases.&quot;  You acknowledge and agree that:  (a) the Product is protected under U.S. copyright and other laws; (b) Borland and its licensors retain all copyrights and other intellectual property rights in the Product; (c) there are no implied licenses under this License, and any rights not expressly granted to you hereunder are reserved by Borland; (d) you acquire no ownership or other interest (other than your license rights) in or to the Product; and (e) Borland owns all copies of the Product, however made.  You agree that you will not, at any time, contest anywhere in the world Borland's ownership of the Product, nor will you challenge the validity of Borland's rights in the Product.  You have no rights hereunder to use any trademark or service mark belonging to Borland.</p>

<p>2.	GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE.<br>
2.1 	Licenses. For each license that you acquire to use the Product, you will be provided with a License Certificate (a &quot;License Certificate&quot;), which may be either a certificate, the installation and licensing instructions, your invoice, an activation file or an email message from Borland and which may be provided to you either with the Product media or separately by Borland or its authorized distributors or resellers.  The License Certificate will contain information specific to the edition of the Product that you have licensed (StarTeam Standard v. 2005, StarTeam Enterprise v. 2005, and StarTeam Enterprise Advantage v. 2005), the type of license under which you may use the Product and the number of licenses that you have acquired.  In order to activate and use the Product as set forth in this License Agreement, you must follow the instructions when prompted by the Product.  The types of licenses you may acquire are an Evaluation License, a Named User License, and a Concurrent User License as outlined in this Section 2 of this License Agreement.  Unless your License Certificate identifies your acquisition of another license type, you have acquired a Named User License.  For more information on which license types, if any, should be included with the Product media you should contact Borland or your Borland authorized distributor or reseller. Regardless of type of license, each copy of the Product contains (i) software that provides services on a computer called a server (&quot;Server Software&quot;) and (ii) software that allows a computer or workstation to access or utilize the services provided by the Server Software (&quot;Client Software&quot;), collectively, both are herein referred to as the &quot;Product&quot; herein.  Under any type of license acquired, for each copy of the Product licensed by Licensee, Licensee may install one copy of the Server Software on a single computer (the computer running the Server Software shall be referred to as the &quot;Server&quot;). The number of Client Software copies that may be installed is determined by the type of license acquired as set forth below.</p>

<p>2.2 Evaluation License.  The terms of this Section 2.2 are applicable to you only if you have acquired an Evaluation License, as defined below, for the Product directly from Borland or a Borland authorized distributor or reseller. In order to evaluate the Product, you may install the Product, as outlined below, on a temporary basis for trial, evaluation, non-commercial purposes only (the &quot;Evaluation Period&quot;).  The Evaluation Period is limited to the greater of the period of time specified to you by Borland or thirty (30) days from the date the Product is installed.  At the end of the Evaluation Period your license to use the Product expires.  During the Evaluation Period, Borland grants you the personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for evaluation purposes.  THE PRODUCT CONTAINS A TIME-OUT FEATURE THAT DISABLES ITS OPERATION AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD.  APPLICATIONS THAT YOU CREATE DURING THE EVALUATION PERIOD MAY REQUIRE THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO RUN. UPON EXPIRATION OF THE EVALUATION PERIOD, THOSE APPLICATIONS MAY NO LONGER RUN.  YOU SHOULD THEREFORE TAKE PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID ANY LOSS OF DATA THAT MIGHT RESULT.  In order to use the Product after the Evaluation Period, you must obtain from Borland, or its authorized distributors or resellers a License Certificate outlining the number and type of grants of a license to use the Product in accordance with the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  You may not use the Product during the Evaluation Period for any commercial, business, governmental or institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the Evaluation Period, further use of the Product by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial license.  If you do not purchase a license for the Product at the end of the Evaluation Period, you hereby agree to permanently remove or delete the Product from all computer systems, including Servers, as defined herein, and workstations, on which it was installed and return or destroy any software and documentation received, and not to reinstall the Product. If you desire to continue to use the Product following the Evaluation Period, you should contact Borland or a Borland authorized distributor or reseller to order commercial licenses to use the Product.</p>

The terms of this Section 2.3 are applicable to you only if you have acquired a Named User License, as defined below, for the Product directly from Borland or a Borland authorized distributor or reseller. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Borland grants to you, if you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in your organization (&quot;Named User&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to use the Product solely for your own internal purposes. You may purchase from Borland or a Borland authorized distributor or reseller additional licenses to permit multiple Named Users to use the Product (each, a &quot;Named User License&quot;).  The foregoing Named User Licenses shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of Named Users for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Certificate.  The Product may be used exclusively by the specifically designated Named Users, subject to all the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  You agree that you will not designate more Named Users than the number of Named User Licenses that Borland or a Borland authorized distributor or reseller has expressly granted to you and you will not allow the Product to be used by any individuals other than the Named Users designated by you from time to time.  For each Named User, you may install the Client Software on up to five (5) computers provided that the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the Product.  Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product (Server and Client Software) to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Borland grants to you a nonexclusive, nontransferable and limited license to install the Client Software, in executable form only, on a reasonable number of computers or machines or on a server accessed and used by multiple users, provided that the Client Software is used only by as many concurrent users at any given moment in time as you have concurrent licenses under your License Certificate and provided further that your use of the Product is only in the Territory, as defined in 2.4.1 below.  The foregoing license shall be for access and use, only by the equivalent number of concurrent users for whom you have paid the applicable license fees and obtained a License Certificate, solely for your own internal purposes.

The Product may not be shared or used concurrently on computers or machines located outside of the Territory.  You may make a reasonable number of copies of the Product to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of the Product (Server and Client Software) solely to replace the original copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights not specifically granted to you herein are retained by Borland. You agree to maintain accurate records of the use of the Product under each License Certificate you hold.</p>

<p>LICENSE TERMS FOR EXTERNAL TOOLS - The use of one or more external tools, including multiplexors or replicators, to reduce the number of users directly connected to the Product shall not exempt you from acquiring licenses for all users. For example, if you use multiplexing or connection pooling software or hardware to reduce the number of users directly connected to the Product, the number of Named Users or Concurrent Users within your organization using the Product shall be measured as the number of distinct inputs to the multiplexing or connection pooling front end and you shall purchase the equivalent number of Named User or Concurrent User Licenses. If you use replicator software, you may not use the Product to share licenses in any way not explicitly provided for in this Agreement.  You may not use a multiplexor or replicator with this License.</p>

<p>6.3 NO OTHER WARRANTIES.  EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.  BORLAND HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR QUIET ENJOYMENT.  THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION.  YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT.  TO THE EXTENT THAT BORLAND MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW. </p>

<p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.  THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</p>

<p>7.	SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES.  Borland is not required under this License to provide any installation, training or other services to you.  Such services, if available, must be purchased separately.  If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, Borland provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the Product, such modification will be deemed part of the Product, and subject to the terms of this License, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement. Borland reserves the right at any time not to release or to discontinue release of any Product and to alter prices, features, specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the Product.</p>

<p>8.	CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Product (including its underlying source code) and the terms of this License Agreement contain confidential information of Borland.  You agree to hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person (other than your employees and individual contractors who use the Product and who have agreed to keep confidential any of Borland's confidential information that you provide to them), and not use it for any purpose other than the use and operation of the Product as permitted under this License Agreement.  These restrictions do not apply to any information which is or becomes (through no fault of yours) publicly available.  If you are required by law or order of a court or other government authority to disclose Borland's confidential information, then you will immediately notify Borland as soon as possible, but in any event prior to the disclosure, and will cooperate with Borland, at its expense and request, in any lawful action to contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.</p>

<p>9.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT WILL BORLAND BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE, BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF BORLAND KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  BORLAND'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS LICENSE.  THIS SECTION 9 WILL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p>

<p>SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p>10.	THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.  Borland will indemnify, defend and settle any suit brought against you by a third party (not your affiliate) based on a claim that the Product infringes upon any copyright, patent or trade secret recognized under U.S. law and Borland will pay those costs and damages finally awarded against you in such suit that are specifically attributable to such claims or those amounts payable by you under a settlement of such suit. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on you:  (a) notifying Borland promptly in writing of such action; (b) giving Borland sole control of the defense thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at Borland's request and expense, assisting in such defense. If the Product becomes, or in Borland's opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim that Borland is required to defend, then Borland may (at its option and expense) either:  (a) procure for you the right to continue using the Product; (b) replace or modify the Product so that it becomes non-infringing; or (c) terminate this License and your rights hereunder to use the Product and refund a pro rata portion of any license fee you paid under this License, based on a three (3) year product life. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borland will have no obligation under this Section 10 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon:  (a) any use of the Product not in accordance with this License or the Product's accompanying documentation: (b) any use of the Product in combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not provided by Borland; (c) any use of any version of the Product other than the most current version made available to you; or (d) any modification of the Product by any person other than Borland or its authorized agents (&quot;Excluded Claims&quot;). You will indemnify Borland against all liability, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from or related to an Excluded Claim. This section 10 states Borland's entire liability and your sole and exclusive remedy for third-party claims relating to the Product.</p>
