UI/Help/Documentation
- Added chapter to documentation on notification templates and their use.
- Updated the link to the cron trigger help on schedule edit page.
- Added ability for interface tabs to hide themselves.
- Added catch for MigrationExceptions to the AdministrationTab so that common errors show up as error messages rather than execption pages (rather annoying).

Build System
- Expanded JavaDoc to include all classes.
- Added links to external JavaDocs.
- Added separate API JavaDocs.
- Added descriptions to all targets.
- Separated API documentation generation from API compiling.

General
- Fix for system properties not immediately updating when importing a new config.  The webapp was not updating its copy of the properties.

- Added automated backup/export of database (configurable with a cron trigger).

Scheduling

Notification
- Added luntbuild servlet URL as an available variable for templates.
- Added ability to configure templates for specific schedules (this could be better done though).
- Added new notification strategy "Notify if failed or status changed".
- Fixed error messages in TemplatedNotifier.

Contribution from Dominique Leducq. Thanks Dominique!

- Added variables support for a schedule. Variables can be used in the similar fashion as project variables in OGNL expressions.

to <tomcat>/webapp/luntbuild. To reverse bask to original Luntbuild theme, unzip <luntbuild-install>contrib/classic-theme.zip
to <tomcat>/webapp/luntbuild.


Other changes:

- Fixed EHCache configuration
- Improved Clearcase mview delete/recreate

luntbuild 1.3.6 Release Notes
==============================================

Bugs fixed:

Fixed current build update in web app introduced in 1.3.5
MKS integration improvements:
   1. When an objects gets removed form the MKS repository, checking for revisions used to fail (with MKS API error) and failed the build. Now error gets reported into revision log and build proceeds.
   2. Logic was enhanced to detect changes in the MKS modules. Adding/changing the version/checkpoint label or development path to existing MKS module no longer fails the build. Once a change is detected sandbox is dropped and recreated with changed parameters.
StarTeam patch which adds the ability to check out by promotional state to Luntbuild
