===Introduction===

This is a crude beginning of what can become a pretty cool thing.

Disclamer: Before doing this, my experience with GTK programming was non-existent and my
Ruby skills are still quite rudimentary.

===Licenses===

The Luntbuild specific code is available under the MIT license
http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.

The Hessian library is a patched version of Hessian Ruby 1.0.3, which is
licensed under the LGPL, http://www.opensource.org/licenses/lgpl-license.php.
The changes has been submitted to the HessianRuby maintainer at SourceForge.

===Running===

Before starting, edit the settings in luntbuildTray.rb to suit your Luntbuild
installation (

Pre-requisite:
	1) Gnome environment
	2) ruby-1.8.2 (ftp://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/ruby-1.8.2.tar.gz)
	3) ruby-gtk2-0.12.0 (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=53614)
	4) ruby-gtktrayicon-0.1.0 (http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=53614)
	
To run: ruby luntbuildTray.rb
A little icon should appear in your Gnome tray indicating current build status. 

===Future Plans===

1. Make it a decent, tested application. Please view this as spike.
2. Functionality wise, settings should be edited in some GUI of course. I am
thinking of adding sounds that can be played when the status changes.
