<h3>By <a href="mailto:robin@luntsys.com">Robin Shine</a> </h3>
<p><strong>Abstract<br>
<br>A basic daily build system gives a development team the benefit of discovering build integration problems early. However, the development team can benefit further if the build system addresses other important build related issues, such as:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Build promotion.</li>
<li>Integration with automated testing systems.</li>
<li>Integration with project/issue tracking systems.</li>
</ul>
This article describes these issues,
and introduces Luntbuild as an open source daily build and continuous integration tool
that helps to address some of those issues.
</strong></p>
<h3>1. Daily builds and existing problems</h3>
<p><strong>1.1 Common mechanism for a daily build.</strong></p>
<p>Daily builds are widely used by many projects to identify integration problems early.
This article raises some thoughts about the proper setup of a daily build system, and introduces Luntbuild as an open source
daily build tool (hosted at <a href="http://luntbuild.sf.net">http://luntbuild.sf.net</a>).</p>
<p>The daily build process is simple: </p>
<ol>
<li>The source repository is inspected periodically (nightly, for example).</li>
<li>A build is triggered if there are any changes in the source repository, and subsequently unit,
 regression, or smoke tests are performed.</li>
<li>Labels may be applied to the source repository to identify the version of the current build, in order to be
able to reproduce this build later.</li>
<li>Emails may be sent to the development team to report build status.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continuous Integration, a best practice Extreme Programming method, includes these mechanisms, but adopts a more frequent build loop based on the changes in the source code repository.
</p>
<p><strong>1.2 Problems with current daily builds mechanism.</strong></p>
<p>
While a daily build system will help you discover integration problems early, your team can further benefit from the system if the following issues
are addressed: </p>
<ol>
<li>
The build system should be able to make use of different Version Control System (VCS) modules from different branches or labels together
to perform a build, thus providing the maximum flexibility in supporting parallel development.
This is especially useful for large projects.
</li>
<li>
Build history should be managed. Usually a large number of builds are generated
over the course of longer projects, especially when using a Continuous Integration approach.
It is therefore important to categorize the builds in order to highlight the important builds.
There are two ways to do this:
<ul>
<li>
The first method is to promote an already-existing build from a lower category,
for example daily builds category, to a higher level category, for example, a test builds category.
We call this method <strong>post-build categorization</strong>, because the build is categorized after the project has been built.
</li>
<li>
The second method is to directly schedule a build in the desired category.
We call this method <strong>pre-build categorization</strong>, because the category of a build is established before it has been built.
</li>
</ul>
Besides categorization, you should be able to search and/or delete history builds.
It would be convenient to be able to search for a specific build by version, date, status, and so on.
This would help users to identify a specific build quickly without having to navigate through a large number of history builds.
Non-important builds can be deleted in order to save space.
</li>
<li>
Build artifacts should not only include the eventual distribution package, but also some intermediate files,
including debug version files. This is particularly useful for big projects, allowing
the build system to not only perform integrity checking of the source code,
but also provide the team with recent development base or debugging environment.
It would be most convenient to be able to issue a single command to download related artifacts of a particular build,
and update your development environment accordingly.
</li>
<li>
An access control mechanism is needed to control access to different projects, builds or other functions of the system,
particularly in cases where the system is shared by multiple projects
or can be accessed by customers for product downloading, etc.
</li>
<li>
The daily build system should be able to connect to your project issue tracking system,
so that relationship between a build and bug/feature can be defined and stored easily.
For example, a developer should be able to specify when submitting a bug to an issue tracking system that the bug will be fixed in the next build.
The issue tracking system will know the version of the build this bug was submitted to when it gets notified
from the build system after finishing the next build. Also, when you release a particular build,
the build system can contact the issue tracking system to get a list of the bugs and features addressed in that particular build, for example, for inclusion as part of the Release Notes.
</li>
<li>
The daily build system should be able to connect to an automated testing system to perform further
testing after a build. For example, the build system could notify the automated testing system
after generating a new build. The testing system would then download the new build, deploy it, and perform
the necessary test cases by contacting the project testing system.</li>
</ol>
<p>Setting up a daily build is easy, but it is not quite as easy to address all the issues mentioned above.
After exploring a number of existing tools and finding them unsatisfactory, I decided to write a new build automation tool, called Luntbuild, 
to address those issues step by step. Version 1.1.1 has been released, which addresses issues 1, 2, and 3,
in addition to the basic functions of a daily build and continuous integration.
In the following section, I will explore Luntbuild and show how it can help to solve the above issues.</p>

<h3>2. How can Luntbuild help to address these problems?</h3>
<p>
Luntbuild is a build automation and build management system that attempts to be more than just a daily build or continuous integration tool.
It is based on Apache Ant, and it needs an Ant, Maven or shell build script to execute a build.
However, it is very easy to write a wrapper Ant build file to wrap other types of scripts.
The detailed steps for how to execute other types of scripts from the Ant build file
are documented in the Luntbuild's User's Guide.
</p>

<p><strong>2.1 Support for parallel development builds.</strong></p>
<p>
Luntbuild uses the concepts of a project, Version Control System (VCS) adaptor, and schedule to automate and manage builds.
The project is a &quot;real world&quot; project, and corresponds to a set of particular source repositories.
The VCS adaptor is a group of versioned directories or files, usually defined by a path
into the VCS repository with a particular branch or label.
</p>
<p>
For example, we can configure a CVS project &quot;foobar&quot;.
Let's suppose that &quot;foobar&quot; has two directory trees, &quot;src&quot; and &quot;web&quot;.
&quot;src&quot; contains source code, and &quot;web&quot; contains web interface HTML files.<br>
<ul><li>First we create a VCS adaptor with two modules,
&quot;src&quot; and &quot;web&quot;, both using main branch (HEAD). We schedule this project to build nightly.<br>
<li>
The development continues smoothly, and the team decides to release &quot;foobar-1.0 build123&quot;.
Looking forward, we want the customer to report bugs in a category of their issue tracking system called &quot;foobar-1.0 build123&quot;,
related to a functionality in &quot;src&quot; directory.
<li>In order to address these bugs, we can create a &quot;1_0_bugfix&quot; branch for the &quot;src&quot; directory.
A &quot;foobar1.0-bugfix&quot; project is created,
and the VCS adaptor's module is configured so the directory tree &quot;src&quot; will use the &quot;1_0_bugfix&quot; branch,
and the &quot;web&quot; directory tree the label &quot;foobar-1_0-build123&quot;.
The project &quot;foobar&quot; is still used for nightly builds with the schedule <strong>nightly</strong>.
Thus both new feature development and bug fix development
have corresponding projects and schedules configured,
and builds for both of them are scheduled independently.
</ul>
</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Support for build history management</strong></p>
<p>In Luntbuild, schedules are not only used to implement non-interactive builds,
but schedules are also used to implement build categorization.
For example, you can configure your project with three schedules, <strong>hourly</strong>, <strong>nightly</strong>,
and <strong>release</strong>.
The <strong>hourly</strong> and <strong>nightly</strong> schedules will be triggered automatically,
and the <strong>release</strong> build schedule is only triggered manually.
The <strong>hourly</strong> schedule can be configured to build incrementally 
in order to increase the build speed (only code changed since last build is checked out),
and the <strong>do not label</strong> option can be chosen in order not to introduce too many labels into the repository.
The <strong>hourly</strong> schedule mainly serves as the <strong>continuous integration</strong> build,
to ensure the integrity of the source repository. The <strong>nightly</strong> schedule
can be configured as a clean (from scratch) build in order to increase the reliability of the build,
and  the <strong>label when successful</strong> option can be chosen in order to make all nightly builds reproducible.
The <strong>nightly</strong> schedule will be used as the <strong>development environment update</strong>,
which can be used to create the base development environment. 

The <strong>release</strong> build schedule is used 
to produce a build to be released to public. You can use the <strong>pre-build categorization</strong> method by manually
triggering the release build using the <strong>release</strong> schedule, or you can use the
<strong>post-build categorization</strong>
method by moving a particular build
(for example a tested build in the <strong>nightly</strong> category) to the release category.
</p>
<p>
In addition to build categorization and promotion, builds can also be searched by build version with non-exact or exact matches,
by &quot;from date&quot; and &quot;to date&quot;, by status, or by build schedules.
Build deletion can be performed on search results, or on a specific build. For example, you could perform operations
such as &quot;search all failed history builds&quot; and delete them.
Also, for a particular build, existing artifact files can be deleted, and new files can be uploaded, for example, to supply patches for a particular build.</p>

<p><strong>2.3 Support for setting up the latest development environment</strong></p>
<p>Build artifacts published in Luntbuild are generated by the user-supplied build script.
Luntbuild only supplies and tells the script the top publishing directory. It is the user's choice what artifacts to publish.
For large projects, it is convenient if the latest development environment package
(for example, debug version files, etc.) can be published together with the eventual distribution package.
This improves the time required by a developer to re-compile another developer's source code to update his environment.</p>

<p><strong>2.4 Things that are not yet supported, but intended for future development</strong></p>
<p>All unit tests or smoketest jobs are performed in the build script.
The output from the tests will be captured by Luntbuild,
and consequently results will be sent to the person who is responsible for the failure.
(The notification options are configurable, allowing you to select to notify after every build, or to never notify).
Luntbuild will present results of unit tests more cleanly using HTML reporting,
instead of using the raw text log file.</p>
<p>User access control is not yet implemented in Luntbuild. This feature is essential when you want
to use Luntbuild in a team environment, or when you plan to expose Luntbuild system to the public.
This feature is now in planning and it will be available in release 1.2.</p>
<p>Luntbuild does not yet support connection to any third party issue tracking system, or automated testing system.
These features are planned for the later releases. The first step is to provide a web-service like API to allow other systems
 access to Luntbuild build information (available in version 1.2).</p>
