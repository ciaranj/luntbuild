  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>3. Install from Luntbuild installer (with GUI)</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> NOTE: This is clean installation of Luntbuild. For upgrades from version 1.1.1, <br>
      please refer to section 6 of this file. </p>
    <p> 1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which <br>
      contains the java and jar executable into your system path.<br>
      Go to &quot;http://java.sun.com/&quot; for JDK download if you didn't install it yet.</p>
    <p> 2) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application<br>
      server installed, and make sure it has been stopped if you want to deploy<br>
      the war during the installation.</p>
    <p> 3) Download Luntbuild installer from &quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/&quot;.<br>
      This file is normally named as &quot;luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar&quot;, where xxx denotes<br>
      current version.</p>
    <p> 4) Run command &quot;java -jar luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar&quot;. A GUI will display to<br>
      guide you through the installation, and Luntbuild will install into the selected<br>
      directory, let's say &quot;/opt/luntbuild&quot;.</p>
    <p> 5) Deploy luntbuild.war (located in &quot;/opt/luntbuild&quot; directory) into your servlet<br>
      container or application server. Note, that if you selected the deployment<br>
      directory of your servlet container or application server during installation,<br>
      the installer will deploy luntbuild.war for you.</p>
    <p> 6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your<br>
      Luntbuild adventure, :D</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>4. Install from zip distribution (without GUI)</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> NOTE: This is clean installation of Luntbuild. For upgrades from version 1.1.1,<br>
      please refer to section 6 of this file.</p>
    <p> 1) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application<br>
      server installed, and make sure it has been stopped if you want to deploy the war<br>
      during the installation.</p>
    <p> 3) Download the Luntbuild zip distribution from &quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/&quot;.<br>
      This file is normally named as &quot;luntbuild-xxx.zip&quot;, where xxx denotes current version.</p>
    <p> 4) Extract the zip file into the directory where you want to install Luntbuild, say<br>
&quot;/opt/luntbuild&quot;. And edit the following files with your text editor:<br>
    * Edit file &quot;/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/web.xml&quot;:<br>
    Replace &quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; with your Luntbuild installation path (/opt/luntbuild here).<br>
    Replace &quot;${sessionTimeout}&quot; with your desired session timeout value (normally 30).<br>
    * Edit file &quot;/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml&quot;:<br>
    Replace &quot;${luntbuildPassword}&quot; with your desired site administrator password.</p>
    <p> 5) Take all contents under &quot;/opt/luntbuild/web&quot;, and deploy it as a web application of<br>
      your selected application server, or servlet container.</p>
    <p> 6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your<br>
      Luntbuild adventure, :D</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>5. Build from source distribution</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which<br>
      contains the java and jar executable into your system path.<br>
      Go to &quot;http://java.sun.com/&quot; for JDK download if you didn't install it yet.</p>
    <p> 2) Make sure you have Apache ant 1.6.1 (or higher) installed.<br>
      Goto &quot;http://ant.apache.org&quot; for Ant download.</p>
    <p> 3) Download the source distribution from &quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/&quot;.<br>
      This file is normally named as &quot;luntbuild-xxx-src.zip&quot;, where xxx denotes<br>
      current version.</p>
    <p> 4) Extract the source distribution into a directory, let's say<br>
&quot;/yourhome/luntbuild-src&quot;. Change to directory<br>
&quot;/yourhome/luntbuild-src/build&quot;, and run command &quot;ant clean installer zip&quot;.<br>
      Then Luntbuild installer and zip distribution will both be generated into directory<br>
&quot;/yourhome/luntbuild-src/distribute&quot;.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>6. Upgrade from version 1.1.1</strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1) Assuming you've installed luntbuild-1.1.1 under &quot;/opt/luntbuild&quot;. Backup <br>
      the directory &quot;/opt/luntbuild/db&quot; which contains your db files to another location.<br>
      Backup all important build artifacts.</p>
    <p> 2) Upgrade your 1.1.1 web application with war file from:<br>
      http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113344&amp;package_id=122604&amp;release_id=319662<br>
      <br>
      NOTE: This only upgrades web application, and should not change anything<br>
      under &quot;/opt/luntbuild&quot;. </p>
    <p> 3) Access Luntbuild web application again, a new tab &quot;Administration&quot;<br>
      should be displayed. Select this tab, and export data into your specified <br>
      file, let's say &quot;/yourhome/luntbuild-1.1.1-data.xml&quot;. This file will be stored<br>
      on the machine that runs your servlet container or application server<br>
      hosting your Luntbuild application.</p>
    <p> 4) Follow the instructions of section 2 of this file to install Luntbuild 1.2<br>
      into your Luntbuild 1.1.1 installation directory, that is &quot;/opt/luntbuild&quot;<br>
      in this case.<br>
      <br>
      5) Access the Luntbuild web application, click on &quot;Administration&quot; tab, and <br>
      import from previously exported data file &quot;/yourhome/luntbuild-1.1.1-data.xml&quot;.<br>
      That will migrate the luntbuild-1.1.1 data to Luntbuild 1.2 distribution.<br>
      However, some settings of Luntbuild 1.1.1 needs to be re-configured:<br>
      <br>
      * The property &quot;environment file&quot; has been removed in 1.2. If you are using<br>
      this property in 1.1.1, you need to extract contents of the environment <br>
      file, and enter them as &quot;Environment variables&quot; property. </p>
    <p> * All build success condition has been reset for 1.2 format.</p>
    <p> * All build necessary condition has been reset for 1.2 format.</p>
    <p> * Format of property &quot;Next build version&quot; has been changed, please verify <br>
      your version string.</p>
    <p> * Build properties passed to Ant build script has been changed, thus your<br>
      Ant build script need to be changed to use new build properties.</p>
    <p> * Ant builder command has been reset to default value. You may need to change <br>
      it based on your Ant installation directory. <br>
    </p>
