4. Install from Luntbuild installer (with GUI)
-----------------------------

  NOTE: This is clean installation of Luntbuild. For upgrades from version 1.1.1, 
  please refer to section 6 of this file. 

  1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which 
     contains the java and jar executable into your system path.
     Go to "http://java.sun.com/" for JDK download if you didn't install it yet.

  2) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application
     server installed, and make sure it has been stopped.

  3) Download Luntbuild installer from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/".
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar", where xxx denotes
      current version.

  4) Run command "java -jar luntbuild-xxx-installer.jar". A GUI will display to
      guide you through the installation, and Luntbuild will install into the selected
      directory, let's say "/opt/luntbuild".

  5) Deploy luntbuild.war (located in "/opt/luntbuild" directory) into your servlet
     container or application server. Note, that if you selected the deployment
     directory of your servlet container or application server during installation,
     the installer will deploy luntbuild.war for you.

  6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your
     Luntbuild adventure, :D

5. Install from zip distribution (without GUI)
-----------------------------

  NOTE: This is clean installation of Luntbuild. For upgrades from version 1.1.1,
  please refer to section 6 of this file.

  1) Make sure you get one of Luntbuild supported servlet container or application
     server installed, and make sure it has been stopped.

  3) Download the Luntbuild zip distribution from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/".
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx.zip", where xxx denotes current version.

  4) Extract the zip file into the directory where you want to install Luntbuild, say
     "/opt/luntbuild". And edit the following files with your text editor:
     * Edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/web.xml":
       Replace "$INSTALL_PATH" with your Luntbuild installation path (/opt/luntbuild here).
       Replace "${sessionTimeout}" with your desired session timeout value (normally 30).
     * Edit file "/opt/luntbuild/web/WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml":
	   Replace "${luntbuildPassword}" with your desired site administrator password.

  5) Take all contents under "/opt/luntbuild/web", and deploy it as a web application of
      your selected application server, or servlet container.

  6) Access the Luntbuild web application and you should be able to start your
     Luntbuild adventure, :D

6. Build from source distribution
-----------------------------

  1) Make sure you have jdk1.4 or jdk1.5 installed, and add the directory which
     contains the java and jar executable into your system path.
     Go to "http://java.sun.com/" for JDK download if you didn't install it yet.

  2) Make sure you have Apache ant 1.6.1 (or higher) installed.
     Goto "http://ant.apache.org" for Ant download.

  3) Download the source distribution from "http://sourceforge.net/projects/luntbuild/".
      This file is normally named as "luntbuild-xxx-src.zip", where xxx denotes
      current version.

  4) Extract the source distribution into a directory, let's say
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src". Change to directory
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src/build", and run command "ant clean installer zip".
     Then Luntbuild installer and zip distribution will both be generated into directory
     "/yourhome/luntbuild-src/distribute".

6. Upgrade from version 1.1.1 or version 1.2 beta1
-----------------------------

  1) Assuming you've installed Luntbuild under "/opt/luntbuild". Backup 
     the directory "/opt/luntbuild/db" which contains your db files to another location.
     Backup all important build artifacts.

  2) If your previously installed version is 1.1.1, upgrade 1.1.1 web application 
     with war file from:
     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=113344&package_id=122604&release_id=319662
     
     NOTE: This only upgrades web application, and should not change anything
     under "/opt/luntbuild". 

  3) Access Luntbuild web application again, Select "Administration" tab, and export 
     data into your specified file, let's say "/yourhome/luntbuild-data.xml". This file 
     will be stored on the machine that runs your servlet container or application server
     hosting your Luntbuild application.

  4) Follow the instructions of section 4 of this file to install Luntbuild 1.2 beta2
     into your previous Luntbuild installation directory, that is "/opt/luntbuild"
     in this case.
     
  5) Access the Luntbuild web application, click on "Administration" tab, and 
     import from previously exported data file "/yourhome/luntbuild-data.xml".
     That will migrate data of previous Luntbuild installation to latest version.
     However, if your previous version is 1.1.1, some settings needs to be re-configured:
     
     * The property "environment file" has been removed in 1.2. If you are using
       this property in 1.1.1, you need to extract contents of the environment 
       file, and enter them as "Environment variables" property. 

     * All build success condition has been reset for 1.2 format.

     * All build necessary condition has been reset for 1.2 format.

     * Format of property "Next build version" has been changed, please verify 
       your version string.

     * Build properties passed to Ant build script has been changed, thus your
       Ant build script need to be changed to use new build properties.

     * Ant builder command has been reset to default value. You may need to change 
       it based on your Ant installation directory.
