<p>Luntbuild is a build automation and build management system that attempts to be more than just a daily
build or continuous integration tool. Luntbuild uses the concepts of a project, Version Control System (VCS) adaptor,
and schedule to automate and manage builds. The project is a "real world" project, and corresponds
to a set of particular source repositories. The VCS adaptor is a group of versioned directories or files,
usually defined by a path into the VCS repository with a particular branch or label.

You may ask why Luntbuild, while there are already many good build automation tools such as Cruise Control, Anthill,
and others. Our answer is:
<br>
Luntbuild aims at not only being build automation, but also build management system. Executed builds can be categorized,
promoted, searched, patched, deleted, etc. This is very important for a nightly builds or Continuous Integration builds,
which generate many builds over time. Luntbuild utilizes the project/schedule concept to easily provide build support
for parallel development. No configuration files, all jobs are done using web interface.
You can set your Luntbuild system in less than 30 minutes.

Luntbuild 1.2 introduces following new features:
<ul>
<li>Maven builder support
<li>Command shell builder support
<li>ACL based Security (thanks Johannes Plachy)
<li>Project/schedule dependency
<li>Ability to stop running build
<li>Ability to clone/copy a project
<li>Ability to associate different builders with different schedules
<li>Ability to configure "build cleanup strategy" which gives user the option to only keep a specified number of builds, or to keep specified build days for particular schedules
<li>Easier way to specify properties for Ant and Maven builder, separated properties in its own text area
<li>Ability to define multiple builders, VCS adaptors, and schedules for  a project
<li>New File system based Vcs adaptor
<li>New Vcs Aadaptor for AccuRev (thanks Jason Carreira)
<li>Quiet period can be set before check out code for build 
<li>Luntbuild data can be exported to an XML file or imported from an XML file
<li>Ability to notify about build status using Jabber (thanks Johannes Plachy)
<li>More supported servlet containers, application servers: Tomcat, Jetty, Resin, JBoss, JOnAS, SunOne
<li>New notification strategy: "Notify when build status changed"
<li>User password encryption
<li>Hide password from log
<li>Display summary of [http://junit.org JUnit] test results on build page
<li>Upgraded Hsql/Spring and some other 3rd party libraries
<li>For HSQLDB, changed build table definition to be a cached table in HSQL database. This way, rows of build table will be swapped to disk when they become too large
<li>New User's Guide and FAQ documentation
<li>New Luntbuild GUI based installer
<li>Started <a href="http://luntbuild.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/moin.cgi/FrontPage">Luntbuild Project Wiki</a>
</ul>
<p>
Luntbuild supports following application servers/servlet containers:
<ul>
<li>Tomcat 4.x
<li>Tomcat 5.5
<li>Jetty 4.2.23
<li>Jetty 5.1.12
